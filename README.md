- golf::GolfList -> A wrapper for the List class that includes the specific functionalities requested
- golf::Reader -> A simple static class that defines the function to handle file reading.
- golf::Data -> A struct that stores all the required info for each player


The golf specific classes and dataTypes are defined into the namespace golf::
